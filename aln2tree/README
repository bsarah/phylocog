Parse output of dAln (Neya's program) and calculate trees, write in newick file

Output will be two newick files, one with taxids and one with protids that can both be plotted in the next step. Taxids contain (a/b) identifiers to see archaeal and bacterial proteins. Sequence based trees are also labeled with taxids, hence, they are comparable.

#using parameter -v will give verbose output and warnings
